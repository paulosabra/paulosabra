## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paulo Sabra

### Glad to see you here!  
I work as a mobile engineer for [Blueberry Consultants](https://www.bbconsult.co.uk/) and I am a specialist professor at [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/).

I'm a software engineer specialized in mobile development. I have knowledge in Flutter, as well as in Android, using Java and Kotlin. Also, I'm learning React Native, using TypeScript, and iOS, using Swift. With this knowledge and skills I am able to design, develop and deploy high quality mobile apps for a wide range of devices and platforms.
